            //If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.

            //Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,

            //349 + 943 = 1292,
            //1292 + 2921 = 4213
            //4213 + 3124 = 7337

            //That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.

            //Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, 
            //like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome 
            //through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. 
            //Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, 
            //we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. 
            //In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, 
            //it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, 
            //(ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. 
            //In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome: 
            //4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).

            //Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994.

            //How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?

            //NOTE: Wording was modified slightly on 24 April 2007 to emphasise the theoretical nature of Lychrel numbers.
